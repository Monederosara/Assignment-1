We have data about 100798 individuals killed by guns. Only 85111 are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 
```

#Activity 8 - Gun deaths by age 
```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1) 
```

#Activity 9 - Guns death by race
```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
